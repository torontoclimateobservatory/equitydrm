    <h2 class="mission">We are a community of practice dedicated to advancing social equity in disaster risk assessment. Our goal is to develop approaches to disaster risk assessment that do not prioritize dollars lost, but rather, prioritize the needs of vulnerable and marginalized communities.</h2>

        <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <p>Starting in 2022, our group is a growing community consisting of academics, engineers, social scientists, practitioners, and policymakers around the world. Between 2023 and 2024, we came together in a series of interactive virtual sessions to examine real-world case studies and develop methodologies to integrate equity considerations into disaster risk assessment frameworks. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and shared learning, we created a guidance note (coming soon!) with strategies for more inclusive and equity-focused risk assessment practices.</p>
